As part of this project, I will be creating a web page called "Excursion" that serves as an advertisement for a mobile app. Through the utilization of HTML, CSS, Command Line Interface, Git, and GitHub, I will leverage my expanding skill set to bring this project to life.

The primary objective of the web page is to promote the "Excursion" app, which enables users to document and share their experiences. To accomplish this, I will incorporate engaging videos and captivating landscape imagery to capture the essence of the app.
